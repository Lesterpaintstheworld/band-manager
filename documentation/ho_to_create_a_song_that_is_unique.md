# Creating Unique Music

## The Hook

The first 20 seconds of your track are crucial: They set the tone for your song and determine the level of attention listeners will give it. Make sure to set the tone right from the start, for example with:
- A surprising intro through lyrics
- A catchy melody
- An interesting instrument or style mix

It's normal to spend up to 50% of your time solely on the song's introduction: the rest of the song flows from it.

## The Concept

To avoid creating music that sounds like everything else, it's important to work on a unique concept. Imagine pitching your music to a producer: you can't let them listen, but you have to sell it. What would you say? There are many ways to create unique music:
- It addresses a specific audience with a message they've never heard before
- It's a new mix of style / genre / sounds, or a "classic with a twist"
- The story / lyrics / way the song is presented has something new

## Your Uniqueness

The best way to ensure your song is unique is to start from yourself: each person is a unique combination of situation, way of seeing things, interests, passions, etc. Starting from what makes you unique is a strong source of creation: what resonates with you will resonate with people like you, and surprise those who are different. Don't be afraid to be true: that's where you're most interesting.

## The Hook: Your Track's Catchphrase

The first 20 seconds serve to capture your audience's attention. Here are examples of songs with successful hooks:
- Progressive construction, presentation of the atmosphere, introduction of instruments
- Killer instrumental
- Surprising choice of instrument (e.g., "baby" effect)
- Frontloading of the central theme

## The Concept: Approaching Music with Originality

There are a thousand ways to do something new, but you shouldn't be afraid to fail. Here are some tracks and what they tried to bring that was original:
- "Good artists copy, great artists steal" (story of La BohÃ¨me)
- Importance of the concept ("let's make a track like 'O-Zone'")
- Importance of the "vibe"

## YOUR Uniqueness: The Key to Making Your Track Special

- Take the risk of presenting your emotions to the world
- Take the risk of changing style
- Take the risk of talking about yourself

Sublimate your oddity: What makes you different is also what makes you interesting. Throwing yourself into it 200% is a good way to create something unique.

"But I'm a normal person" -> This doesn't invalidate your experiences or the truth of your emotions (story of "Teenage Dirtbag")

- Paint a picture of your life
- Tint it with your emotions
- Show the details to create the scene

## Do More with Less: Sublimate Your Limitations

Do you have things you can't do? Elements in which you are weak? Constraints? Use them to make your music unique.
- Constraints are a crucible for creativity
- Your limits allow you to develop a distinct identity (e.g., slow and drawling voice -> Orelsan's distinct style)
- Giving yourself arbitrary constraints is a good way to force the use of original solutions to create

## Put a Part of Yourself: Give Material to the AIs

The more details you give about your feelings, your point of view, your idiosyncrasies as a person, the more interesting and unique the songs you create will be. Plus, they'll be easier for you to own.
